    "readme": "## Servify\n\nMicroservices the simplest way conceivable.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Create a microservice:\n\n```javascript\nconst servify = require(\"servify\");\n\n// The service state\nlet count = 0;\n\n// Starts a microservice with 3 API methods\nservify.api(3000, {\n\n    // Squares a number\n    square: (x) => x * x,\n\n    // Concats two arrays\n    concat: (a, b) => a.concat(b),\n\n    // Increments and returns the counter\n    count: () => count++\n\n}).then(() => console.log(\"servified port 3000\"))\n```\n\n### Call a microservice from code:\n\n```javascript\nconst servify = require(\"servify\");\n\n// Builds the API interface from an URL\nconst api = servify.at(\"http://localhost:3000\");\n\n// Calls API methods like normal lib functions\napi.square(2)\n    .then(x => console.log(x));\n\napi.concat([1,2], [3,4])\n    .then(arr => console.log(arr));\n\napi.count()\n    .then(i => console.log(i));\n```\n\n### Call a microservice from the browser / request:\n\n```javascript\nJust access the url followed by a function call:\n\nhttp://localhost:3000/square(2)\nhttp://localhost:3000/concat([1,2], [3,4])\nhttp://localhost:3000/count()\n```\n\n## Support\n\nThis requires ES6 Proxy support, so you need node.js 6 and up. Proxies cannot be polyfilled in earlier versions.\n\n## Why\n\nWhen all you want is to create a microservice, [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) becomes annoyingly verbose. You have to worry about things like serializing/deserializing JSON, chosing how to format query/param inputs, picking a XHR lib on the client and so on. Servify is a ridiculously thin (50 LOC) lib that just standardizes that boring stuff. To create a microservice, all you need is an object of functions specifying your API. To interact with a service, all you need is its URL. You can then call its functions exactly like you would call a normal lib (except it returns a Promise, obviously).\n",
