To adjust the local time to the NTP time, add the returned `t` offset\nto the local time.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hueniverse/sntp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hueniverse/sntp)\n\n# Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Sntp = require('sntp');\n\n// All options are optional\n\nvar options = {\n    host: 'nist1-sj.ustiming.org',  // Defaults to pool.ntp.org\n    port: 123,                      // Defaults to 123 (NTP)\n    resolveReference: true,         // Default to false (not resolving)\n    timeout: 1000                   // Defaults to zero (no timeout)\n};\n\n// Request server time\n\nSntp.time(options, function (err, time) {\n\n    if (err) {\n        console.log('Failed: ' + err.message);\n        process.exit(1);\n    }\n\n    console.log('Local clock is off by: ' + time.t + ' milliseconds');\n    process.exit(0);\n});\n```\n\nIf an application needs to maintain continuous time synchronization, the module provides a stateful method for\nquerying the current offset only when the last one is too old (defaults to daily).\n\n```javascript\n// Request offset once\n\nSntp.offset(function (err, offset) {\n\n    console.log(offset);                    // New (served fresh)\n\n    // Request offset again\n\n    Sntp.offset(function (err, offset) {\n\n        console.log(offset);                // Identical (served from cache)\n    });\n});\n```\n\nTo set a background offset refresh, start the interval and use the provided now() method. If for any reason the\nclient fails to obtain an up-to-date offset, the current system clock is used.\n\n```javascript\nvar before = Sntp.now();                    // System time without offset\n\nSntp.start(function () {\n\n    var now = Sntp.now();                   // With offset\n    Sntp.stop();\n});\n```\n\n",
