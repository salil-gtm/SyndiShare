    "readme": "# Decode streams into strings The Right Way(tm)\n\n```javascript\nvar fs   = require('fs')\nvar zlib = require('zlib')\nvar strs = require('stringstream')\n\nvar utf8Stream = fs.createReadStream('massiveLogFile.gz')\n  .pipe(zlib.createGunzip())\n  .pipe(strs('utf8'))\n```\n\nNo need to deal with `setEncoding()` weirdness, just compose streams\nlike they were supposed to be!\n\nHandles input and output encoding:\n\n```javascript\n// Stream from utf8 to hex to base64... Why not, ay.\nvar hex64Stream = fs.createReadStream('myFile')\n  .pipe(strs('utf8', 'hex'))\n  .pipe(strs('hex', 'base64'))\n```\n\nAlso deals with `base64` output correctly by aligning each emitted data\nchunk so that there are no dangling `=` characters:\n\n```javascript\nvar stream = fs.createReadStream('myFile').pipe(strs('base64'))\n\nvar base64Str = ''\n\nstream.on('data', function(data) { base64Str += data })\nstream.on('end', function() {\n  console.log('My base64 encoded file is: ' + base64Str) // Wouldn't work with setEncoding()\n  console.log('Original file is: ' + new Buffer(base64Str, 'base64'))\n})\n```\n",
